# Distance Between Two Vectors

- Imagine that each observation in a dataset lives in a *P*-dimensional space, where *P* is the number of predictors. 

  - Obsevation 1: $\mathbf{A} = (A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_P)$

  - Obsevation 2: $\mathbf{B} = (B_1, B_2, B_3, ..., B_P)$

- A general definition of distance between two vectors is the **Minkowski Distance**. 

$$\left ( \sum_{i=1}^{P}|A_i-B_i|^q \right )^{\frac{1}{q}},$$
where $q$ can take any positive value.

---

- Suppose that we have two observations and three predictors

  - Observation 1:  (20,25,30)

  - Observation 2:  (80,90,75)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

x1 <- c(20,80)
x2 <- c(25,90)
x3 <- c(30,75)

plot_ly(x = x1, y = x2, z = x3,type='scatter3d',mode='markers',
        width=600,height=400) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X1'),
                      yaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X2'),
                      zaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X3'))) %>%
  layout(scene = list(camera = list(eye = list(x = 1.25,y = 1.25,z = 0))))
```

---

- If we assume that the $q=1$ for the Minkowski equation above, then we can calculate the distance as the following:

.indent[
.single[
.tiny[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

A <- c(20,25,30)
B <- c(80,90,75)

sum(abs(A - B))
```
]]]

- If we assume that the $q=2$ for the Minkowski equation above, then we can calculate the distance as the following:

.indent[
.single[
.tiny[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

A <- c(20,25,30)
B <- c(80,90,75)

(sum(abs(A - B)^2))^(1/2)
```
]]]


- If we assume that the $q=3$ for the Minkowski equation above, then we can calculate the distance as the following:

.indent[
.single[
.tiny[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

A <- c(20,25,30)
B <- c(80,90,75)

(sum(abs(A - B)^3))^(1/2)
```
]]]
---

When $q$ is equal to 1 for the Minkowski equation, it becomes a special case known as **Manhattan Distance**. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE,warning=FALSE}

plot_ly(x = x1, y = x2, z = x3,type='scatter3d',mode='markers',
        width=800,height=500) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X1'),
                      yaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X2'),
                      zaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X3'),
                      camera= list(eye = list(x = 1.25,y=1.25,z=1.25)))) %>%
  add_trace(x =c(x1[1],x1[1]),y=c(x2[1],x2[1]),z=c(x3[1],x3[2]), mode="lines") %>%

  add_trace(x =c(x1[1],x1[2]),y=c(x2[2],x2[2]),z=c(x3[2],x3[2]), mode="lines") %>%
  layout(showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  layout(scene = list(camera = list(eye = list(x = 1.25,y = 1.25,z = 0))))

```

---

When $q$ is equal to 2 for the Minkowski equation, it is also a special case known as **Euclidian Distance**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE,warning=FALSE}

plot_ly(x = x1, y = x2, z = x3,type='scatter3d',mode='markers',
        width=800,height=500) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X1'),
                      yaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X2'),
                      zaxis = list(range = c(0,100),title='X3'))) %>%

# K-Nearest Neighbors

- When there are $N$ observations in a dataset, a distance between any observation and $N-1$ remaining observations can be computed using Minkowski distance (with a user-defined choice of $q$ value, a hyperparameter). 

- Then, for any given observation, we can rank order the remaining observations based on how close they are to the given observation and then decide the K observations closest based on their distance.

- Suppose that there are ten observations measured on three predictor variables (X1, X2, and X3) with the following values.

Given that there are ten observations, we can calculate the distance between all 45 pairs of observations (e.g., Euclidian distance).

The $q$ in the Minkowski distance equation and $K$ in the K-nearest neighbor are user-defined hyperparameters in the KNN algorithm. As a researcher and model builder, you can pick any values for $q$ and $K$. They can be tuned using a similar approach applied in earlier classes for regularized regression models. One can pick a set of values for these hyperparameters and apply a grid search to find the combination that provides the best predictive performance.

It is typical to observe overfitting (high model variance, low model bias) for small values of K and underfitting (low model variance, high model bias) for large values of K. In general, people tend to focus their grid search for K around $\sqrt{N}$.

It is essential to remember that the distance calculation between two observations is highly dependent on the scale of measurement for the predictor variables. If predictors are on different scales, the distance metric formula will favor the differences in predictors with larger scales, and it is not ideal. Therefore, it is essential to center and scale all predictors before the KNN algorithm so each predictor similarly contributes to the distance metric calculation.

# Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors

Below is a list of steps for predicting an outcome for a given observation.

  - 1. Calculate the distance between the observation and the remaining $N-1$ observations in the data (with a user choice of $q$ in Minkowski distance).

  - 2. Rank order the observations based on the calculated distance, and choose the K-nearest neighbor. (with a user choice of $K$)

  - 3. Calculate the mean of the observed outcome in the K-nearest neighbors as your prediction.

Note that Step 3 applies regardless of the type of outcome. 

If the outcome variable is continuous, we calculate the average outcome for the K-nearest neighbors as our prediction. 

If the outcome variable is binary (e.g., 0 vs. 1), then the proportion of observing each class among the K-nearest neighbors yields predicted probabilities for each class.

---

### An example of predicting a continuous outcome with the KNN algorithm

1. Import the data

2. Write a recipe for processing variables

3. Apply the recipe to the dataset


.indent[
.single[
.tiny2[

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

# Import the dataset

readability <- read.csv('./data/readability_features.csv',header=TRUE)

# Write the recipe

require(recipes)

blueprint_readability <- recipe(x     = readability,
                                vars  = colnames(readability),
                                roles = c(rep('predictor',768),'outcome')) %>%
  step_zv(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_nzv(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) 

# Apply the recipe

baked_read <- blueprint_readability %>% 
  prep(training = readability) %>%
  bake(new_data = readability)
```
]]]


Our final dataset (`baked_read`) has 2834 observations and 769 columns (768 predictors; the last column is target outcome). 

Suppose we would like to predict the readability score for the first observation. 

---

The code below will calculate the Minkowski distance (with $q=2$) between the first observation and each of the remaining 2833 observations by using the first 768 columns of the dataset (predictors).

.indent[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

dist <- data.frame(obs = 2:2834,dist = NA,target=NA)

for(i in 1:2833){
  
  a <- as.matrix(baked_read[1,1:768])
  b <- as.matrix(baked_read[i+1,1:768])
  dist[i,]$dist   <- sqrt(sum((a-b)^2))
  dist[i,]$target <- baked_read[i+1,]$target

  #print(i)
}

```
]]]

---

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
load(here('donotupload/knn_readability_prediction_demo.RData'))
```

We now rank-order the observations from closest to the most distant and then choose the 20 nearest observations (K=20). 

.single[
.tiny[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

# Rank order the observations from closest to the most distant

dist <- dist[order(dist$dist),]

# Check the 20-nearest neighbors

print(dist[1:20,], row.names = FALSE)
```
]]

---

Finally, we can calculate the average of the observed outcome for the 20 nearest neighbors, which will become our prediction of the readability score for the first observation.

.tiny[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
mean(dist[1:20,]$target)
```
]

The observed outcome (readability score) for the first observation.

.tiny[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
readability[1,]$target
```
]
---

### An example of predicting a binary outcome with the KNN algorithm

- We can follow the same procedures to predict Recidivism in the second year after an individual's initial release from prison. 

- The final dataset (`baked_recidivism`) after pre-processing has 18111 observations and 142 predictors.

- Suppose that we would like to predict the probability of Recidivism for the first individual. 

- The code below will calculate the Minkowski distance (with $q=2$) between the first individual and each of the remaining 18,110 individuals by using values of the 142 predictors in this dataset.

.indent[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

dist2 <- data.frame(obs = 2:18111,dist = NA,target=NA)

for(i in 1:18110){
  
  a <- as.matrix(baked_recidivism[1,3:144])
  b <- as.matrix(baked_recidivism[i+1,3:144])
  dist2[i,]$dist   <- sqrt(sum((a-b)^2))
  dist2[i,]$target <- as.character(baked_recidivism[i+1,]$Recidivism_Arrest_Year2)

  #print(i)
}

```
]]]

---

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
load(here('./donotupload/knn_recidivism_prediction_demo.RData'))
```

Suppose we now rank-order the individuals from closest to the most distant and then choose the 20-nearest observations. 

Then, we calculate proportion of individuals who were recidivated (YES) and not recidivated (NO) among these 20-nearest neighbors. 

.pull-left[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

dist2 <- dist2[order(dist2$dist),]

print(dist2[1:20,],
      row.names = FALSE)
```
]]]

.pull-right[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
table(dist2[1:20,]$target)

# The observed outcome for the first individual

recidivism[1,]$Recidivism_Arrest_Year2

```
]]]

These proportions predict the probability of being recidivated or not recidivated for the first individual.

The probability of the first observation to be recidivated within 2 years is 0.2 (4/20) based on 20 nearest neighbors.

---

# Kernels to Weight the Neighbors

- In the previous section, we used a simple average of the observed outcome from K-nearest neighbors. 

- A simple average implies equally weighing each neighbor. 

- Another way of averaging the target outcome from K-nearest neighbors would be to weigh each neighbor according to its distance and calculate a weighted average. 

- A simple way to weigh each neighbor is to use the inverse of the distance. 
- For instance, consider the earlier example where we find the 20-nearest neighbor for the first observation in the readability dataset.

- We can assign a weight to each neighbor by taking the inverse of their distance and rescaling them such that the sum of the weights equals 1.

---

.pull-left[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

dist <- dist[order(dist$dist),]

k_neighbors <- dist[1:20,]

print(k_neighbors,row.names=FALSE)
```
]]]


.pull-right[
.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
k_neighbors$weight <- 1/k_neighbors$dist
k_neighbors$weight <- k_neighbors$weight/sum(k_neighbors$weight)

print(k_neighbors,row.names=FALSE)
```
]]]


Compute a weighted average of the target scores instead of a simple average.

.single[
.tiny2[
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
sum(k_neighbors$target*k_neighbors$weight)
```
]]

---

Several kernel functions can be used to assign weight to K-nearest neighbors

- Epanechnikov

- Rectangular

- Quartic

- Triweight

- Tricube

- Gaussian

- Cosine

For all of them, closest neighbors are assigned higher weights while the weight gets smaller as the distance increases, and they slightly differ the way they assign the weight. 

---

Below is a demonstration of how assigned weight changes as a function of distance for different kernel functions.
